How often have we stood in front of our wardrobes completely confused about what to wear?
Matching this shirt with these pants or this jacket, itâ€™s often overwhelming and exhausting.
We aim to rectify this problem by designing a recommendation system to inform the user what his
best options are given the clothes they have. The user enters the clothes available or just takes a
picture to begin. The model, trained using images in fashion articles or websites, finds the best
combination from those clothes and returns it thereby saving the user endless headaches and time.
